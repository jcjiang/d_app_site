# DALI Lab Application Website

Here's my website!  Contains interactive JS portions (hover over some sentences and watch them change, click on a picture and watch it shift!) and the ability to scroll to certain parts of the webpage using the navbar.

Theoretically, the page has been pushed to [here](https://jcjiang.github.io/d_app_site/) but an image is not showing up despite being saved in Github.  Therefore, for full functionality, I recommend that you clone the repo and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` or whichever local server you would like to see my website.

P.S. Sorry for this submission being 2 hours late, it was unclear at what time the application was due on the 20th and I assumed the usual 11:59 PM thing.  Well, you know what they say about assuming... Anyways, I had most everything done by the deadline, I just had to upload and do final bug fixing for the scrolling functionality.  Please let me know if this is an issue!
