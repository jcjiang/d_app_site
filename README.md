# DALI Lab Application Website

Here's my website!  Contains interactive JS portions (hover over some sentences and watch them change, click on a picture and watch it shift!) and the ability to scroll to certain parts of the webpage using the navbar.

Theoretically, the page has been pushed to (title)[https://jcjiang.github.io/d_app_site/] but an image is not showing up despite being saved in Github.  Therefore, for full functionality, I recommend that you clone the repo and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` or whichever local server you would like to see my website.
